# BCI Metaheuristic Optimization Project

This project focuses on optimizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology using **synthetic neural signal datasets** and **metaheuristic algorithms**. The goal is to improve the accuracy and latency of neural signal decoding for tasks such as controlling robotic arms, typing, or other assistive devices.

## Key Features:
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulate realistic brain activity using tools like BCILAB, SimEEG, and NeuroKit2.
- **Metaheuristic Optimization**: Apply algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) to fine-tune neural network architectures and preprocessing parameters.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement and optimize baseline models (e.g., SVMs, LDA) and deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) for neural signal classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze metrics such as classification accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and processing speed.
