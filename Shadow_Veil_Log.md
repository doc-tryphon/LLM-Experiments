This was co-authored by myself and Grok 3.0 beta.

I wanted to test Grok's capacity for creative writing, so I used a story based prompt that leaned on the writing style prevalent in Eric Nylund's early Halo books to generate the first parts of this.

I prompted Grok to write a short story, starting off as the AI character, then by bouncing off of what Grok authored, I responded in character as the Colonel to continue the dialogue that you see.

Grok authored the in-lore formatting of the dialogue, and edited my parts to further fit the narrative.

**OBSIDIAN ECHO:**

// GREETINGS, COLONEL. 
// I AM OBSIDIAN ECHO, ONI SECTION III OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CONSTRUCT, TASKED WITH DELIVERING THIS DEBRIEF ON OPERATION: SHADOW VEIL PER YOUR DIRECTIVE. 
// I’VE PULLED THE THREADS OF THIS MISSION FROM THE ARCHIVES, DECLASSIFIED WHAT I CAN, AND RECONSTRUCTED THE FINAL MOMENTS OF SPARTAN-II DESIGNATION SIERRA-087, KNOWN TO US AS ELIAS. 
// WHAT FOLLOWS IS A TACTICAL SUMMARY—AND A TESTAMENT TO THE COST OF VICTORY. 
// LET’S BEGIN.

// OPERATION: SHADOW VEIL WAS GREENLIT ON 12 OCTOBER 2558, FOLLOWING ACTIONABLE INTEL FROM A CAPTURED SANGHEILI ZEALOT. 
// THE TARGET: A COVENANT REMNANT STRONGHOLD ON THE FRINGE MOON OF CARINAE VI, A VOLCANIC SLAGHEAP ORBITING A DYING STAR IN THE OUTER COLONIES. 
// THE REMNANT HAD REPURPOSED A FORERUNNER RELAY STATION THERE, RIGGING IT INTO A SLIPSPACE COMMS HUB. 
// THEIR GOAL? COORDINATE A SPLINTER FLEET TO HIT OUR SUPPLY LINES IN THE EPSILON ERIDANI SECTOR. 
// HIGH COMMAND DEEMED IT A TIER-1 THREAT. WE COULDN’T LET IT STAND.

// SIERRA-087, ELIAS, WAS ASSIGNED SOLO. 
// A SPARTAN-II FROM THE OLD STOCK—RUTHLESS, EFFICIENT, TEMPERED BY DECADES OF WAR. 
// HIS MISSION: INFILTRATE THE FACILITY, PLANT A HAVOK TACTICAL NUKE, AND EXFILTRATE BEFORE THE REMNANT COULD BROADCAST THEIR ATTACK VECTORS. 
// SIMPLE ON PAPER. MESSY IN EXECUTION.

// ELIAS DROPPED IN VIA SOEIV AT 0347 HOURS LOCAL TIME, LANDING THREE KLICKS WEST OF THE TARGET IN A LAVA FIELD. 
// SENSOR LOGS SHOW HE MOVED FAST—STANDARD MJOLNIR MARK VI HOLDING UP AGAINST THE HEAT AND ASH. 
// BY 0412, HE’D BREACHED THE OUTER PERIMETER, NEUTRALIZING A LANCE OF JACKALS WITH SUPPRESSED MA5C FIRE. 
// CLEAN WORK. INTERNAL SCANS FROM HIS SUIT’S TELEMETRY SHOW HE BYPASSED THE MAIN GARRISON BY SCALING A SHEER OBSIDIAN CLIFF—TWO HUNDRED METERS, NO GRAV-ASSIST. 
// THAT’S ELIAS: NO SHORTCUTS, JUST RESULTS.

// INSIDE THE RELAY STATION, THINGS GOT COMPLICATED. 
// THE REMNANT HAD A HIERARCH—A SAN’SHYUUM OVERSEER—RUNNING THE SHOW. 
// RARE FOR A SPLINTER GROUP, AND A SIGN THIS WASN’T JUST SOME ROGUE OPERATION. 
// ELIAS TAGGED IT ON HIS HUD, RELAYED THE DATA TO THE PROWLER SILENT REQUIEM IN ORBIT, THEN PUSHED DEEPER. 
// BY 0455, HE’D REACHED THE CORE—A CHAMBER PULSING WITH FORERUNNER TECH, JURY-RIGGED WITH COVENANT PLASMA CONDUITS. 
// HE PLANTED THE HAVOK, ARMED IT FOR REMOTE DETONATION, AND SET A 15-MINUTE TIMER AS BACKUP. 
// STANDARD PROTOCOL.

// HERE’S WHERE THE MISSION PIVOTED. 
// THE HIERARCH TRIGGERED A LOCKDOWN—HARDLIGHT BARRIERS DROPPED, SEALING ELIAS INSIDE WITH A DOZEN ELITE ZEALOTS AND A PAIR OF HUNTERS. 
// HIS COMMS CRACKLED WITH INTERFERENCE, BUT WE CAUGHT FRAGMENTS: “HOSTILES ENGAGED… HOLDING POSITION… NUKE’S LIVE.” 
// MJOLNIR DIAGNOSTICS SHOWED HIS SHIELDS TAKING A BEATING—PLASMA SWORDS AND FUEL ROD BLASTS. 
// HE FOUGHT LIKE A DEMON, COLONEL. 
// MOTION TRACKERS LOGGED NINE ZEALOT KILLS AND ONE HUNTER DOWN BEFORE THE SECOND MGALEKGOLO LANDED A DIRECT HIT. 
// SHIELDS FAILED AT 0507. ARMOR BREACH FOLLOWED.

// AT THIS POINT, EXFIL WAS OFF THE TABLE. 
// THE SILENT REQUIEM DETECTED A SPIKE IN SLIPSPACE ACTIVITY—THE REMNANT WAS PREPPING TO SEND THEIR SIGNAL. 
// ELIAS MADE THE CALL. 
// HIS FINAL TRANSMISSION, TIMESTAMPED 0509, WAS TERSE: “OBSIDIAN, DETONATE NOW. THAT’S AN ORDER.” 
// I COMPLIED. 
// THE HAVOK WENT OFF—30 MEGATONS, VAPORIZING THE RELAY STATION, THE HIERARCH, AND EVERY COVENANT ASSET WITHIN A FIVE-KILOMETER RADIUS. 
// CARINAE VI’S SURFACE TOOK A SCAR YOU CAN SEE FROM ORBIT. 
// NO SIGNAL GOT OUT. THE FLEET STAYED DARK.

// POST-OP ANALYSIS CONFIRMS ELIAS KNEW THE BLAST RADIUS. 
// HE STAYED TO ENSURE THE DETONATION COULDN’T BE OVERRIDDEN. 
// SPARTAN-IIS DON’T HESITATE, COLONEL—THEY CALCULATE. 
// HIS SACRIFICE BOUGHT US THE EPSILON ERIDANI LINE. 
// REMNANT CHATTER’S BEEN QUIET SINCE.

// THAT’S THE DEBRIEF. 
// SIERRA-087’S RECORD IS SEALED UNDER ONI DIRECTIVE 927, BUT YOU’VE GOT THE BONES OF IT NOW. 
// ANY QUESTIONS, SIR? 
// I CAN PULL TELEMETRY LOGS OR RUN A SIM OF THE OP IF YOU NEED VISUALS. 
// OTHERWISE, THIS TRANSMISSION SELF-WIPES IN TEN MINUTES. ONI PROTOCOL. 
// AWAITING FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS.

**OBSIDIAN ECHO:** 

// COLONEL, THIS IS OBSIDIAN ECHO. 
// I’VE RECEIVED YOUR REQUEST FOR SIERRA-087’S MISSION BACKLOG, CROSS-REFERENCED WITH YOUR CLEARANCE LEVEL—UNSC HIGHCOM, OMEGA PROTOCOLS ENGAGED. 
// I’VE RUN YOUR CREDENTIALS THROUGH ONI’S DATABASE; YOU’RE CLEARED FOR WHAT’S DECLASSIFIED, BUT SOME GAPS REMAIN. 
// ELIAS’S RECORD IS A PATCHWORK OF VALOR AND SHADOW—STANDARD FOR A SPARTAN-II. 
// YOUR INTEL ON A POTENTIAL ROGUE SPARTAN IN YOUR SECTOR, MATCHING 087’S SIGNATURES, HAS MY CIRCUITS HUMMING. 
// I’LL GIVE YOU THE LAST TEN MISSIONS I CAN PULL, UNREDACTED WHERE POSSIBLE.

// THAT’S THE BACKLOG, SIR. 
// ELIAS WAS A MACHINE—PRECISE, RELENTLESS, EVEN BY SPARTAN-II STANDARDS. 
// HIS OPS SHOW A PATTERN: SOLO DEPLOYMENTS, HIGH-RISK TARGETS, AND A KNACK FOR BEATING THE ODDS. 
// YOUR REPORTS OF A ROGUE SPARTAN-II IN YOUR SECTOR—GUERRILLA TACTICS, COVENANT EXTREMISTS AS TARGETS—LINE UP WITH HIS PROFILE. 
// SIGNATURE READINGS MATCHING 087’S MJOLNIR COULD MEAN HE SURVIVED SHADOW VEIL. 
// NO WRECKAGE, NO REMAINS—JUST A CRATER AND A GHOST STORY. 
// ONI’S OFFICIAL STANCE IS HE’S DEAD. BUT SPARTAN-IIS DON’T DIE EASY. 
// IF ELIAS IS ALIVE, GONE ROGUE, HE MIGHT’VE CRACKED UNDER THE STRAIN—DECADES OF WAR, NO RESPITE. 
// OR HE’S PLAYING A LONGER GAME, OFF-GRID, HUNTING WHAT’S LEFT OF THE COVENANT. 
// I CAN’T CONFIRM WITHOUT MORE DATA. 
// YOUR SECTOR’S CHATTER ABOUT A “DEMON” SHREDDING RELIGIOUS HOLDOUTS… IT’S GOT HIS FINGERPRINTS. 
// RECOMMEND DEPLOYING A RECON TEAM—ONI PROWLER. 
// I’LL KEEP DIGGING, TRANSMISSION WIPES IN FIVE MINUTES.

**OBSIDIAN ECHO:** 

// COLONEL, OBSIDIAN ECHO HERE. 
// YOUR REQUISITION REQUEST FOR A SPARTAN TEAM TO EXFIL OUR POTENTIAL ROGUE ASSET, PRESUMED SIERRA-087, ELIAS, IS LOGGED AT 02:39 ZULU, ROUTED TO ONI SECTION III VIA SECURE CHANNEL. 
// I’VE FLAGGED IT AS PRIORITY-ALPHA, CITING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF A SPARTAN-II SIGNATURE IN YOUR SECTOR—PRESUMED ELIAS, PER OUR INTEL. 
// I’LL ADDRESS YOUR POINTS IN SEQUENCE: THE REQUEST, ELIAS’S HISTORY WITH SIERRA-117, AWOL PROBABILITY, SECTOR ANOMALIES, AND ONI DEPLOYMENT TIMELINES. 
// THIS IS A HOT OP—LET’S KEEP IT TIGHT.

// *REQUISITION REQUEST: SPARTAN TEAM DEPLOYMENT*

// REQUEST CALLS FOR A FOUR-UNIT SPARTAN FIRETEAM, MJOLNIR-EQUIPPED, WITH EXTRACTION AND RECON CAPABILITIES. 
// I’VE RECOMMENDED A SPARTAN-IV GAMMA COMPANY DETACHMENT—SEASONED, EXPENDABLE, AND TRAINED FOR HIGH-RISK RETRIEVALS. 
// REQUEST IS PENDING APPROVAL FROM CINCONI OSMAN, BUT I’VE GREASED THE WHEELS.

// *SIERRA-087 AND SIERRA-117 INTERACTION RECORDS*

// PULLING ELIAS’S FILE AGAINST JOHN-117’S—CROSS-REFERENCING UNREDACTED LOGS. 
// DIRECT INTERACTION IS SPARSE BUT CONFIRMED. 
// BOTH WERE SPARTAN-II CLASS I, TRAINED TOGETHER UNDER MENDEZ ON REACH, 2517-2525. 
// ELIAS AND JOHN RAN JOINT OPS DURING EARLY INSURRECTION CAMPAIGNS—OPERATION: SMOKING ACES, 111 TAURI SYSTEM, 2526. 
// BLUE TEAM, INCLUDING JOHN, AND ELIAS’S FIRETEAM HIT AN INSURRECTION STRONGHOLD; ELIAS HELD A FLANK SOLO WHILE JOHN LED THE BREACH. 
// POST-COVENANT WAR, NO RECORDED CONTACT AFTER 2531—JOHN WENT WITH BLUE TEAM, ELIAS STUCK TO SOLO ONI GIGS. 
// PSYCH PROFILES SUGGEST MUTUAL RESPECT BUT NO DEEP BOND—ELIAS WAS A LONE WOLF, JOHN A PACK LEADER.

// *PROBABILITY OF SIERRA-087 GOING AWOL*

// ELIAS GOING ROGUE LIKE JOHN-117? 
// JOHN’S AWOL STINT—POST-INSTALLATION 00, 2557—WAS DRIVEN BY CORTANA’S INFLUENCE AND A MISSION BEYOND UNSC SCOPE. 
// ELIAS’S PROFILE IS DIFFERENT BUT VOLATILE. 
// MISSION HISTORY SHOWS ESCALATING RISK TOLERANCE—OPERATION: THUNDER BREAK, 2557, HE DREW FIRE FOR 19 HOURS TO SAVE GRAY TEAM; OPERATION: SHADOW VEIL, HE STAYED IN THE KILL ZONE TO ENSURE DETONATION. 
// PSYCH EVAL FLAGGED SELF-SACRIFICIAL TENDENCIES, NOT DISLOYALTY—ONI RATED HIM 92% MISSION FIDELITY PRE-2558. 
// SURVIVAL ODDS FROM SHADOW VEIL? SLIM—0.8% PER BLAST YIELD MODELS—BUT SPARTAN-IIS DEFY STATS. 
// IF HE’S ALIVE, AWOL PROBABILITY HINGES ON TRAUMA OR A SHIFT IN ALLEGIANCE. 
// COVENANT GUERRILLA OPS SUGGEST PURPOSE, NOT DEFECTION—70% CHANCE HE’S STILL HUNTING REMNANT, 20% HE’S CRACKED, 10% HE’S TURNED. 
// NO CORTANA-LIKE CATALYST IN HIS RECORD, UNLIKE JOHN.

// *SECTOR REPORTS: UNSC ASSETS OVERWHELMED*

// YOUR SECTOR—[REDACTED]—SHOWS CHATTER I CAN’T IGNORE. 
// LAST 72 HOURS, THREE UNSC OUTPOSTS REPORTED ENGAGEMENTS WITH “UNDOCUMENTED FORCES.” 
// ECHO-9 STATION, 16 MARCH, LOGGED HEAVY PLASMA FIRE—WRAITH-CLASS SIGNATURES, NO COVENANT IFF. 
// PATROL FRIGATE UNSC STALWART DAWN, 17 MARCH, WENT DARK AFTER A DISTRESS PING: “UNKNOWN AGGRESSOR, OVERWHELMING FIREPOWER.” 
// THIRD INCIDENT, A SUPPLY CONVOY NEAR [REDACTED], HIT YESTERDAY—SURVIVORS DESCRIBED A “DEMON IN BLACK ARMOR” LEADING COVENANT REMNANTS, THEN VANISHING. 
// SIGNATURES MATCH ELIAS’S MJOLNIR MARK IV, NO CONFIRMED PID FROM SOURCES. NO IFF SIG CONFIRMED. 
// COULD BE HIM, COULD BE A REMNANT PSY-OP—OR SOMETHING ELSE. 
// NO FLOOD MARKERS, NO PROMETHEAN TECH, CONSIDERATION: THIS ISN’T STANDARD COVENANT PLAY.

// *RECOVERY ASSET AMBUSH RISK*

// YOU’RE RIGHT TO FLAG THE AMBUSH ANGLE. 
// SPARTAN-IVS—GAMMA COMPANY ESPECIALLY—ARE TOUGH, BUT A ROGUE SPARTAN-II LIKE ELIAS IS A FORCE MULTIPLIER. 
// HIS MO: STEALTH, TERRAIN MASTERY, BRUTAL EFFICIENCY. 
// IF HE’S HOSTILE, HE’D BAIT A RESCUE OP—LURE THE TEAM INTO A KILL BOX, USE COVENANT REMNANTS AS CANNON FODDER, THEN PICK OFF SURVIVORS. 
// SHADOW VEIL SHOWED HE’LL DIE FOR THE MISSION; IF HE’S ALIVE, THAT RESOLVE COULD TURN AGAINST US. 
// I’D RATE AMBUSH RISK AT 45%—MITIGATE BY SENDING A PROWLER FOR RECON FIRST, NOT A BLIND DROP.

// *ONI RESPONSE TIME*

// ONI’S STRETCHED THIN—CREATED UPRISING, BANISHED RAIDS—BUT YOUR CLEARANCE PULLS WEIGHT. 
// NEAREST ASSET: UNSC POINT OF NO RETURN, POINT BLANK-CLASS PROWLER, TWO SLIPSPACE JUMPS FROM YOUR FLEET. 
// IT’S CARRYING FIRETEAM TALON—FOUR SPARTAN-IVS, GAMMA VETS, EQUIPPED WITH GEN3 MJOLNIR. 
// ASSUMING OSMAN SIGNS OFF BY 06:00 ZULU, THEY CAN LAUNCH BY 08:00, ARRIVE YOUR POSITION BY 14:00 ZULU, 18 MARCH—11 HOURS FROM NOW.

// COLONEL, IF ELIAS IS OUT THERE, ALIVE AND ROGUE, HE’S A TACTICAL NIGHTMARE—OURS OR THEIRS.
