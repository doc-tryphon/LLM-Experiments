## Project Timeline

### The Journey

**~2015**: [Hello World](hello-world/) - First program (symbolic starting point)  
**2015-2024**: Dormant period - programming knowledge dormant  
**September 2025**: Return to CS with quantum computing focus  
**September 30, 2025**: Phase 1 Quantum Protocols complete (170 tests passing)  
**October 3, 2025**: LLM-Experiments repository launched with Git infrastructure  
**Current**: Working toward Step 6 (Shor's 9-Qubit Code)

### Future Milestones

**Phase 2** (Q4 2025): Advanced error correction (Steps 6-9)  
**Phase 3** (Q1 2026): Quantum algorithms (Grover, Deutsch-Jozsa, Phase Estimation)  
**Phase 4** (Q2 2026): Surface codes and VQE  
**Long-term**: Complete 15-step quantum framework, expand to AI implementations

## Project Philosophy

### Educational Focus

This repository emphasizes **learning through rigorous implementation**:
- Deep understanding over surface-level code
- Mathematical derivations before numerical implementations
- Comprehensive testing to verify understanding
- Clear documentation for future reference

### Intellectual Honesty

As a day-one Computer Science student, this repository prioritizes:
- Acknowledging what I don't know
- Verifying claims against authoritative sources
- Building foundations before advanced topics
- Learning from mistakes and iterations

### Version Control as Learning Tool

This repository serves as:
- A record of learning progression
- A portfolio of completed projects
- A reference for future coursework
- An accountability system for quality standards

## Using This Repository

### Converting LLM Output to Markdown

When creating `.md` files from LLM conversations:

```
convert this text to a .md file for publishing on github, 
format it in a way that maintains the original formatting style, 
i.e breaks and spacing:
```

### Quality Standards

For projects marked as "research-grade" (like quantum protocols):
- All code is tested and verified
- All equations are symbolically derived
- All claims are cited with peer-reviewed sources
- No speculative or unverified content

For experimental/creative projects:
- Marked clearly as exploratory
- Learning outcomes documented
- Iterations and improvements tracked
