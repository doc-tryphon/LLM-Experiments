# LLM-Experiments
This repository contains projects and experiments that I have ran with common access, free to use LLM's.

Initially I was inspired to use LLM's to teach me how to program AI.

Later I tested Grok's creative writing capacity, after it informed me that capacity was part of it's programming.
