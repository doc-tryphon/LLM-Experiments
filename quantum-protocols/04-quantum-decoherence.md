## Overview

Quantum decoherence is the process by which quantum systems lose their quantum coherence due to interaction with the environment, causing quantum superpositions to evolve into classical mixtures. Understanding decoherence is essential for quantum error correction and building practical quantum computers.

## Decoherence Channels

### 1. Bit Flip Channel (X-error)

**Physical Model**: Random X gate applied with probability p

**Kraus Operators**:
```
K₀ = √(1-p) · I = √(1-p) [1  0]
                          [0  1]

K₁ = √p · X = √p [0  1]
                 [1  0]
```

**Effect on Superposition**:
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

→ ρ = (1-p)|ψ⟩⟨ψ| + p X|ψ⟩⟨ψ|X†
```

With probability 1-p, state unchanged. With probability p, |0⟩ ↔ |1⟩ flipped.

**Purity Decay**:
```
Tr(ρ²) = 1 - 4p(1-p)|αβ|²
```

### 2. Phase Flip Channel (Z-error)

**Physical Model**: Random Z gate applied with probability p

**Kraus Operators**:
```
K₀ = √(1-p) · I

K₁ = √p · Z = √p [1   0]
                 [0  -1]
```

**Effect on Superposition**:
```
|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2

→ ρ = (1-p)|+⟩⟨+| + p Z|+⟩⟨+|Z†
  = (1-p)|+⟩⟨+| + p|-⟩⟨-|
```

Destroys coherence in X basis but preserves Z basis populations.

### 3. Depolarizing Channel

**Physical Model**: With probability p, state is replaced by maximally mixed state I/2

**Kraus Operators**:
```
K₀ = √(1-3p/4) · I
K₁ = √(p/4) · X
K₂ = √(p/4) · Y
K₃ = √(p/4) · Z
```

**Evolution**:
```
ρ → (1-p)ρ + p(I/2)
```

For p=1, any input state becomes completely mixed.

**Physical Interpretation**: State randomly undergoes I, X, Y, or Z error.

### 4. Amplitude Damping (T₁ Relaxation)

**Physical Model**: Energy dissipation to environment (spontaneous emission)

**Kraus Operators**:
```
K₀ = [1      0    ]
     [0  √(1-γ)]

K₁ = [0  √γ]
     [0   0]
```

where γ = 1 - e^(-t/T₁)

**Effect**:
```
|1⟩ → √(1-γ)|1⟩ + √γ|0⟩
|0⟩ → |0⟩  (ground state stable)
```

**Physical Meaning**: 
- Excited state |1⟩ decays to ground state |0⟩
- Energy lost to environment
- T₁ is the energy relaxation time

**Population Evolution**:
```
ρ₁₁(t) = ρ₁₁(0) e^(-t/T₁)
ρ₀₀(t) = ρ₀₀(0) + ρ₁₁(0)(1 - e^(-t/T₁))
```

### 5. Phase Damping (T₂ Dephasing)

**Physical Model**: Phase information loss without energy loss

**Kraus Operators**:
```
K₀ = [1        0    ]
     [0  √(1-λ)]

K₁ = [0      0]
     [0  √λ]
```

where λ = 1 - e^(-t/T₂)

**Effect on Superposition**:
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

ρ₀₁ → ρ₀₁(0) e^(-t/T₂)  (coherence decays)
ρ₀₀, ρ₁₁ → unchanged     (populations preserved)
```

**Physical Meaning**:
- Phase coherence lost
- Energy (populations) preserved
- T₂ is the decoherence time
- Always T₂ ≤ 2T₁

## Lindblad Master Equation

General form for open quantum system evolution:

```
dρ/dt = -i[H,ρ] + Σᵢ(LᵢρLᵢ† - ½{Lᵢ†Lᵢ,ρ})
```

where:
- H is the system Hamiltonian
- Lᵢ are Lindblad operators (jump operators)
- {...} is the anticommutator: {A,B} = AB + BA

**Properties**:
1. Preserves Hermiticity: ρ† = ρ
2. Preserves Trace: Tr(ρ) = 1
3. Preserves Positivity: ρ ≥ 0
4. Completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map

### Example: Amplitude Damping as Lindblad

```
L = √γ σ₋ = √γ [0  1]
              [0  0]

dρ/dt = γ(σ₋ρσ₊ - ½{σ₊σ₋,ρ})
```

where σ₋ = |0⟩⟨1| (lowering operator), σ₊ = |1⟩⟨0| (raising operator)

## Purity as Decoherence Measure

**Purity Definition**:
```
P = Tr(ρ²)
```

**Properties**:
- Pure state: P = 1
- Maximally mixed state (d dimensions): P = 1/d
- Range: 1/d ≤ P ≤ 1

**Example - Bit Flip Channel**:
```
Initial: |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
P(0) = 1

After bit flip with prob p:
P(t) = 1 - 2p(1-p)

Maximally mixed (p=0.5): P = 0.5
```

## Experimental Observations

### Measured T₁ and T₂ Times

Different quantum computing platforms:

| Platform | Typical T₁ | Typical T₂ |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Superconducting qubits | 50-100 μs | 20-80 μs |
| Trapped ions | 1-100 s | 0.1-10 s |
| Quantum dots | 0.1-1 ms | 1-100 μs |
| NV centers in diamond | 1-10 ms | 0.1-2 ms |

**Note**: T₂ ≤ 2T₁ is always satisfied (theoretical bound)

5. **Realistic Quantum Simulation**: Modeling noisy quantum systems

## Educational Insights

### Why T₂ ≤ 2T₁?

Energy relaxation (T₁) causes both:
1. Population decay (|1⟩ → |0⟩)
2. Phase randomization

Pure dephasing (T₂*) only causes:
1. Phase randomization

Total dephasing rate:
```
1/T₂ = 1/(2T₁) + 1/T₂*
```

Therefore: T₂ ≤ 2T₁ always.

### Classical Limit

As decoherence increases (p → 1 or t → ∞):
- Off-diagonal terms → 0 (coherences destroyed)
- Diagonal terms remain (classical probabilities)
- ρ becomes classical probability distribution

This explains the quantum-to-classical transition.

### Measurement as Decoherence

Measurement can be modeled as extreme decoherence:
- Instantaneous T₂ → 0
- Off-diagonal elements vanish
- Diagonal elements collapse to single basis state
