## Overview

## Multi-Qubit Gates

### CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT)

**Matrix Representation**:
```
CNOT = |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ I + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗ X
     = [1 0 0 0]
       [0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 0 1]
       [0 0 1 0]
```

**Action**:
```
|00⟩ → |00⟩
|01⟩ → |01⟩
|10⟩ → |11⟩  (flip target if control = 1)
|11⟩ → |10⟩  (flip target if control = 1)
```

### Toffoli Gate (CCNOT - Doubly Controlled-NOT)

**Matrix**: 8×8 matrix (acts on 3 qubits)

**Action**:
```
|abc⟩ → |ab(c ⊕ ab)⟩

Only flips target c if both controls a AND b are 1:
|110⟩ → |111⟩
|111⟩ → |110⟩
All other basis states unchanged
```

**Universality**: Toffoli + Hadamard = universal for quantum computation

### Fredkin Gate (CSWAP - Controlled-SWAP)

**Action**:
```
|abc⟩ → |a,bc⟩  if a = 0
|abc⟩ → |a,cb⟩  if a = 1  (swap b and c)

Example:
|100⟩ → |100⟩  (control = 1, so swap)
|101⟩ → |110⟩
|110⟩ → |101⟩
```

### SWAP Gate

**Matrix**:
```
SWAP = [1 0 0 0]
       [0 0 1 0]
       [0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 0 1]
```

**Action**:
```
|00⟩ → |00⟩
|01⟩ → |10⟩
|10⟩ → |01⟩
|11⟩ → |11⟩
```

## 3-Qubit Bit Flip Code

### Encoding

**Logical Basis**:
```
|0⟩_L = |000⟩
|1⟩_L = |111⟩
```

**General State Encoding**:
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
    ↓
|ψ⟩_L = α|000⟩ + β|111⟩
```

**Circuit Implementation**:
```
|ψ⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩
    ↓ CNOT₁₂
    ↓ CNOT₁₃
α|000⟩ + β|111⟩
```

### Syndrome Measurement

Measure two **parity checks** without destroying the logical state:

**Syndrome Operators**:
```
Z₀Z₁ = measures parity of qubits 0 and 1
Z₁Z₂ = measures parity of qubits 1 and 2
```

**Syndrome Table**:
```
Syndrome [0,0] → No error
Syndrome [1,1] → Error on qubit 0
Syndrome [1,0] → Error on qubit 1
Syndrome [0,1] → Error on qubit 2
```

**Key Property**: Syndrome measurement does not collapse the logical state superposition!

### Error Correction Circuit

**Full Protocol**:
1. Encode: |ψ⟩ → α|000⟩ + β|111⟩
2. Noise: Bit flip on one qubit
3. Syndrome: Measure Z₀Z₁ and Z₁Z₂
4. Correction: Apply X to identified qubit
5. Decode: α|000⟩ + β|111⟩ → α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

**Example with Error on Qubit 1**:
```
α|000⟩ + β|111⟩
    ↓ X error on qubit 1
α|010⟩ + β|101⟩
    ↓ Syndrome measurement
Syndrome = [1,0] → Error on qubit 1
    ↓ Apply X₁
α|000⟩ + β|111⟩  (corrected!)
```

## Logical Error Rate

### Physical vs Logical Error Probability

**Physical Error Probability**: p per qubit per operation

**Logical Error Probability**: p_L (after error correction)

For 3-qubit bit flip code:
```
p_L = P(2 or 3 errors)
    = 3p²(1-p) + p³
    = 3p² - 2p³
```

**Benefit Region**: p_L < p when p < 1/2

**Example**:
- p = 0.01 (1% error rate)
- p_L = 3(0.01)² - 2(0.01)³ ≈ 0.0003 (0.03%)
- **Improvement: 33× reduction**

### Break-Even Point

Error correction provides benefit only when p < p_break:
```
p_L = p
3p² - 2p³ = p
p(3p - 2p² - 1) = 0
p_break ≈ 0.5
```

Below 50% physical error rate, error correction helps. Above 50%, it makes things worse.

### Threshold Theorem

With more sophisticated codes and fault-tolerant operations, the threshold can be increased to ~1%. This is the **quantum error correction threshold** - if physical error rate is below threshold, arbitrarily long quantum computation is possible.

## Limitations of the 3-Qubit Code

**What It Protects Against**:
- Single bit flip (X) error on any one of the three qubits

**What It Does NOT Protect Against**:
- Phase flip (Z) errors
- Y errors (bit flip + phase flip)
- Multiple simultaneous errors
- Measurement errors
- Gate errors during syndrome measurement

**Why?**: The code only uses Z-basis syndrome measurement, which detects X errors but not Z errors.

**Solution**: More advanced codes like Shor's 9-qubit code or Steane 7-qubit code protect against all single-qubit errors.

## Fault-Tolerant Syndrome Measurement

**Challenge**: Syndrome measurement itself can introduce errors

**Solution**: Use ancilla qubits and controlled operations

**Fault-Tolerant Circuit**:
```
Data qubits: |ψ⟩₀|0⟩₁|0⟩₂
Ancilla:     |0⟩ₐ|0⟩_b

Measure Z₀Z₁: CNOT₀→ₐ, CNOT₁→ₐ, Measure ancilla a
Measure Z₁Z₂: CNOT₁→_b, CNOT₂→_b, Measure ancilla b
```

Key properties:
- Single error in syndrome extraction doesn't cause data error
- Can detect and correct syndrome measurement errors
- Essential for scalable quantum computation

## Educational Insights

### Why Syndrome Measurement Doesn't Collapse the State

The key insight: we measure **parity** (Z₀Z₁) not individual qubits.

For state α|000⟩ + β|111⟩:
- Z₀Z₁|000⟩ = +1 · |000⟩ (even parity)
- Z₀Z₁|111⟩ = +1 · |111⟩ (even parity)

Both components have the same parity, so measuring parity doesn't distinguish them!

After error on qubit 1:
- Z₀Z₁|010⟩ = -1 · |010⟩ (odd parity)
- Z₀Z₁|101⟩ = -1 · |101⟩ (odd parity)

Still doesn't distinguish between α and β.

### Redundancy vs Quantum No-Cloning

How can we use redundancy (three copies) when quantum no-cloning forbids copying?

**Answer**: We don't copy the state. We create **entanglement**:
```
|ψ⟩ ≠ |ψ⟩|ψ⟩|ψ⟩  (forbidden - this is cloning)
|ψ⟩_L = α|000⟩ + β|111⟩  (allowed - this is entanglement)
```

The encoded state is a single entangled state, not three copies.

### Classical vs Quantum Error Correction

**Classical**: Majority vote on three copies  
**Quantum**: Cannot "vote" without collapsing superposition

**Solution**: Syndrome measurement extracts error information without measuring the data qubits directly.
