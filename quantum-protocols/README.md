# Quantum Computing Framework

**Research-Grade Implementation of Verified Quantum Protocols**

Version: 1.0.0  
Status: Phase 1 Complete (5/15 steps)  
Test Coverage: 170/170 tests passing (100%)  
Last Updated: September 30, 2025

## Mission Statement

This project implements rigorously verified quantum computing protocols containing only experimentally validated results with complete mathematical proofs. Every equation is derived symbolically using SymPy before numerical implementation. Every protocol is tested comprehensively. Zero speculation.

## Core Principles

**1. Experimental Grounding**  
If it hasn't been observed in a lab or doesn't have an analytical solution, it doesn't belong in this codebase.

**2. Mathematical Rigor**  
Every equation must be derived symbolically before being coded numerically.

**3. Comprehensive Testing**  
100% test coverage for all implemented protocols.

**4. Educational Value**  
Code should teach quantum mechanics, not just simulate it.

**5. Research Quality**  
Every line of code should be suitable for peer-reviewed publication.

## What This Project Is NOT

- Not a simulation framework (we don't simulate from first principles)
- Not a quantum hardware interface (not connected to real quantum computers)
- Not a tutorial (we don't hand-hold through basics)
- Not speculative physics (no wormholes, no exotic matter, no unverified theories)

## What This Project IS

- A verified implementation of quantum protocols
- A mathematical proof system for quantum information
- A research-grade toolkit for quantum computing
- An educational resource for deep understanding
- A foundation for future quantum software
