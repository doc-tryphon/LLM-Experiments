## Overview

Quantum teleportation is a protocol for transmitting the quantum state of a particle from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication. Despite the name, no matter or energy is transported - only quantum information.

## Mathematical Results Verified

All results verified to numerical tolerance 10⁻¹⁰:

1. **Perfect Fidelity**: F = 1.0 for all computational basis states
2. **Superposition Preservation**: F = 1.0 for arbitrary superposition states
3. **No-Signaling Theorem**: ρ_Bob = I/2 before classical message (maximally mixed state)
4. **Resource Consumption**: 1 ebit (entangled bit) + 2 classical bits
5. **All Measurement Outcomes**: 4 possible outcomes correctly handled
6. **Pauli Corrections**: I, X, Z, XZ gates applied correctly based on measurement

## Protocol Description

### The Teleportation Protocol (Bennett et al. 1993)

**Goal**: Alice wants to send quantum state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ to Bob

**Resources**:
- Alice and Bob share entangled pair |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
- Classical communication channel (2 bits)

**Steps**:

1. **Initial State**:
   ```
   |ψ₀⟩ = |ψ⟩ₐ ⊗ |Φ⁺⟩ₐᵦ
        = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
   ```

2. **Alice performs Bell measurement** on her qubit and her half of entangled pair:
   ```
   Measurement outcomes:
   - |Φ⁺⟩ → Bob has α|0⟩ + β|1⟩  (apply I)
   - |Φ⁻⟩ → Bob has α|0⟩ - β|1⟩  (apply Z)
   - |Ψ⁺⟩ → Bob has α|1⟩ + β|0⟩  (apply X)
   - |Ψ⁻⟩ → Bob has α|1⟩ - β|0⟩  (apply XZ)
   ```

3. **Alice sends 2 classical bits** indicating her measurement outcome

4. **Bob applies Pauli correction** based on Alice's message:
   ```
   00 → I  (identity)
   01 → Z  (phase flip)
   10 → X  (bit flip)
   11 → XZ (both flips)
   ```

5. **Result**: Bob's qubit is now in state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

## Mathematical Derivation

### Complete State Evolution

**Step 1 - Initial state**:
```
|ψ₀⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩)ₐ ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)ₐᵦ/√2
```

**Step 2 - Rewrite in Bell basis**:
```
|ψ₁⟩ = 1/2 [|Φ⁺⟩ₐₐ(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩)ᵦ 
          + |Φ⁻⟩ₐₐ(α|0⟩ - β|1⟩)ᵦ
          + |Ψ⁺⟩ₐₐ(α|1⟩ + β|0⟩)ᵦ
          + |Ψ⁻⟩ₐₐ(α|1⟩ - β|0⟩)ᵦ]
```

**Step 3 - After Alice's measurement**:
Each outcome occurs with probability 1/4:
- Measure |Φ⁺⟩ → Bob has α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- Measure |Φ⁻⟩ → Bob has α|0⟩ - β|1⟩  
- Measure |Ψ⁺⟩ → Bob has α|1⟩ + β|0⟩
- Measure |Ψ⁻⟩ → Bob has α|1⟩ - β|0⟩

**Step 4 - Bob's correction**:
After applying appropriate Pauli gate, Bob's state is always:
```
|ψ_final⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ = |ψ_initial⟩
```

## No-Signaling Theorem

Before receiving Alice's classical message, Bob's reduced density matrix is:

```
ρ_Bob = Tr_Alice(|ψ₁⟩⟨ψ₁|) = I/2
```

This is a **maximally mixed state** - Bob has zero information about the original state |ψ⟩ until he receives the classical message. This proves quantum teleportation cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.

## No-Cloning Theorem

Teleportation does **not** violate the no-cloning theorem because:
1. Alice's original qubit is destroyed by the measurement
2. The quantum state is transferred, not copied
3. After teleportation, only Bob has the state |ψ⟩

## Educational Insights

### Why 2 Classical Bits?

Alice's Bell measurement has 4 possible outcomes (the 4 Bell states), requiring log₂(4) = 2 classical bits to communicate.

### Why Entanglement + Classical = Quantum Info

The protocol demonstrates that:
- Entanglement alone cannot transfer quantum information (no-signaling)
- Classical communication alone cannot transfer quantum information (no-cloning)
- **Both together** enable quantum information transfer

This is sometimes expressed as:
```
1 qubit + 1 ebit + 2 classical bits → 1 qubit (elsewhere)
```

### Comparison to Classical Communication

To send a qubit state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ classically would require:
- Infinite precision to specify α and β (uncountably many real/complex numbers)

Quantum teleportation achieves this with:
- Finite resource: 1 shared ebit
- Finite communication: 2 classical bits
- Perfect fidelity: F = 1.0
