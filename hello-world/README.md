## About This Folder

This folder contains the most fundamental program in computer science: `Hello, World!`

I wrote my first version about a decade ago. Then life happened, programming became dormant knowledge, and the path took other turns. In 2025, I returned—not to relearn basics, but to build quantum computing frameworks with research-grade rigor and professional infrastructure.

But someone once said: **"Commit everything to GitHub, even your hello world moment."**

This folder honors that advice. It's not about the code—the code is trivial. It's about acknowledging that every complex quantum protocol, every verified algorithm, every research-grade project starts with these twelve characters.

## The Philosophy

**Every programmer's journey starts with Hello World.**

- Beginners write it to learn syntax
- Experts write it to test environments
- Professionals write it to verify toolchains
- Researchers write it to confirm their setup works

It's the most written program in history. It's also the most important one, because it proves the foundational truth: **you can make the computer do what you tell it to do.**

Everything else—quantum error correction, machine learning, distributed systems, whatever comes next—builds on that simple proof.

## What's Inside

- **hello.py** - Python version (approachable, modern)
- **hello.c** - C version (classic, foundational)
- **hello.md** - Philosophical reflection on this folder's purpose
- **README.md** - This file

All of these were written in 2025, representing a symbolic reconstruction of that original 2015 moment. The exact original code is lost to time, but the spirit is preserved here.

## Timeline Context

This folder represents the **symbolic starting point** of a longer journey:

**~2015**: First Hello World  
**2015-2024**: Dormant period  
**2025**: Return to programming with quantum computing focus  
**October 2025**: LLM-Experiments repository launched  
**Phase 1 Complete**: 5 quantum protocols, 170 tests passing  
**Next**: Steps 6-15, advanced protocols and algorithms

## Why This Matters

**For portfolio reviewers**: This shows I understand that fundamentals matter, that continuity exists across skill levels, and that documentation discipline applies to everything—even the trivial.

**For future me**: When debugging complex systems, remember this folder. You started here. Everyone does. That's not a limitation—it's the foundation.

**For other learners**: If you're intimidated by advanced projects in this repository, know that they all trace back to these simple files. The path from hello.c to quantum error correction is long, but it's traversable.

## A Note on Authenticity

I didn't actually save my 2015 hello world code. Like most beginners, I ran it, saw it work, and moved on. This folder is a **time capsule reconstruction**—written in 2025 to honor a 2015 moment.

The code is symbolically accurate, even if not literally identical. The spirit is preserved. The lesson is the same: every programmer starts somewhere simple.

And that's okay.

## Running These Programs

**Python**:
```bash
python hello-world/hello.py
```

**C** (compile first):
```bash
gcc hello-world/hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

Both will print:
```
Hello, World!
From a decade ago, to today, to what comes next.
```

## Final Thought

Someone wise said to commit everything, even your hello world moment.

They were right.

Not because the code matters—it doesn't.

But because **the journey matters**. And the journey starts here, with everyone, no exceptions.

If you found this folder, you've found the foundation. Everything else in this repository builds on this simple truth: we can make computers do what we tell them to do.

From there, we can do anything.

*"Hello, World!"* - The first program, the last program, the program that never stops being relevant.
