## Why This Folder Exists

Someone once said, "Commit everything to GitHub, even your hello world moment."

I wrote my first `Hello, World!` about ten years ago. Like many people, I moved on, tried other things, and programming became dormant knowledge. But in 2025, I returned—not as a beginner relearning basics, but as someone building quantum computing frameworks with research-grade rigor, implementing verified protocols, and establishing professional infrastructure.

This folder isn't about the code. The code is trivial. This folder is about **honoring the journey**.

## What This Represents

**Continuity**: From that first print statement to quantum error correction, it's all part of the same path.

**Humility**: No matter how complex the projects become, we all started with these 12 characters: `Hello, World!`

**Respect for the craft**: Every expert was once a beginner. Every quantum protocol started with someone learning to compile their first program.

**Documentation discipline**: If it's worth doing, it's worth committing. Even—especially—the fundamentals.

## The Files

- `hello.py` - Python, approachable and expressive
- `hello.c` - C, the foundation that built computing
- `hello.md` - This reflection
- `README.md` - Context for anyone who finds this

## For Future Reference

When working on Step 15 of the quantum roadmap, when debugging complex entanglement dynamics, when frustrated with syndrome measurement circuits—remember this folder.

You started here. Everyone does. And that's not just okay—it's essential.
